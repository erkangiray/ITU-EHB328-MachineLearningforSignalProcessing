# ITU-EHB328-MachineLearningforSignalProcessing
Repository for all the work I do for my Fall 2022 Machine Learning for Signal Processing class. 

Class was given in Turkish at Istanbul Technical University.

<b>HW1-Jupyter Notebook</b>
Did my work on Python using Jupyter Notebooks. In the first homework we were given an xml file containing a dataset of 50 examples with 4 features for 3 classes.<br><br>
<i> Tasks:</i>
<br>  1-Obtain the mean vector of each class
<br>  2-Obtain the covariance matrix of each class
<br>  3-Explain what the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix mean
<br>  4-Are the non-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix zero? If not, explain why

<b>Class Project Topic Proposal</b>
This is the proposal for our class project. For our class project we are expected to find an article on machine learning research and recreate its results. For this reason, the article should have its own codes and dataset available online, on GitHub. <br>
The article I chose: <br>
